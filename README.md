# NodeJsPractice

A NodeJS Server with a simple React App with two functionalities, one to lookup a meta tag in a url and the other, to lookup dns txt record in a domain.

If you want to deploy this on your local machine, clone the repo and run the command : npm start and you can access the webpage on http://localhost:8000

For Dev Purpose, if you want to alter the React App, clone the repo and run the command: cd antstack -> npm start and now make changes to the React App to see the live changes on http://localhost:3000 and for upgrading the Node Server with the modified React App, run the command: npm run build and now you can access the modified React App by running your node server.
